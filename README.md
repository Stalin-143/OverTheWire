# Bandit Level 12 → Level 13 Walkthrough

## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file `data.txt`, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level, it may be useful to create a directory under `/tmp` in which you can work. Use `mkdir` with a hard-to-guess directory name or, better, use the command `mktemp -d`. Then copy the data file using `cp`, and rename it using `mv` (read the manpages!).

## Commands You May Need
- `grep`
- `sort`
- `uniq`
- `strings`
- `base64`
- `tr`
- `tar`
- `gzip`
- `bzip2`
- `xxd`
- `mkdir`
- `cp`
- `mv`
- `file`

## Helpful Reading Material
- [Hex dump on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump)

## Steps to Solve

### Step 1: Connect to the Server
Use the following command to connect via SSH:
```bash
ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Enter the password for `bandit12` when prompted.

### Step 2: Create a Temporary Working Directory
Create a unique temporary directory under `/tmp` and navigate into it:
```bash
tempdir=$(mktemp -d)
cd "$tempdir"
```

### Step 3: Copy and Convert the Hexdump Back to a File
Copy the `data.txt` file to your working directory:
```bash
cp ~/data.txt .
```
Convert the hexdump back to binary:
```bash
xxd -r data.txt > data.bin
```

### Step 4: Extract the Compressed Data
Use `file` to determine the file type:
```bash
file data.bin
```
Extract the file using the appropriate decompression tool. Repeat this process multiple times until you get a readable text file:
```bash
# If gzip compressed
gzip -d data.bin || mv data.bin data.gz && gunzip data.gz

# If bzip2 compressed
bzip2 -d data || mv data data.bz2 && bunzip2 data.bz2

# If tar archive
tar -xf data
```
If `file data` shows **bzip2 compressed data**, extract it with:
```bash
bzip2 -d data
```
Then, check the file type again:
```bash
file data.out
```
Repeat the extraction process until you reach a readable text file.

### Step 5: Retrieve the Password
Once fully decompressed, open the final text file and copy the password:
```bash
cat data
```
If the last extracted file is a gzip file:
```bash
mv data8.bin data8.gz
gunzip data8.gz
```
Check the file type again:
```bash
file data8
```
If it is ASCII text, view it:
```bash
cat data8
```

BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
```

### 2. Use Netcat to Send the Password
The challenge requires sending the current password to `localhost` on port `30000`. Use the following command:

```sh
echo "BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr" | nc localhost 30000
```

Alternatively, you can manually enter the password using Netcat:

```sh
nc localhost 30000
```
Then, type the password and press **Enter**.

### 3. Retrieve the Password for Level 15
After submitting the password, you will receive a response with the password for `bandit15`. It should look like this:

```
Correct! The password for bandit15 is <NEW_PASSWORD>
```

Make sure to save this password for logging into Level 15.

### 4. Log in to Level 15
Now, use the new password to log in to the next level:

```sh
ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

# Bandit Level 15 → Level 16 Walkthrough

## Level Goal

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port `30001` on `localhost` using SSL/TLS encryption.

## Commands You May Need

- `ssh`
- `nc` (netcat)
- `openssl s_client`
- `ncat`
- `socat`

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Log in to Level 15

Use the provided credentials to log in to the Bandit server:

```sh
ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Password for `bandit15` (from the previous level):

```
<PREVIOUS_PASSWORD>
```

### 2. Use OpenSSL to Send the Password

Since the communication requires SSL/TLS encryption, we use `openssl s_client`:

```sh
echo "<PREVIOUS_PASSWORD>" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001 -quiet
```

Alternatively, manually enter the password using OpenSSL:

```sh
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
```

When connected, type the password and press **Enter**.

### 3. Retrieve the Password for Level 16

After submitting the password, you will receive a response with the password for `bandit16`. It should look like this:

```
Correct! The password for bandit16 is <NEW_PASSWORD>
```

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c6010b5-b1f3-4db7-b34e-d8ec02244d95)

Make sure to save this password for logging into Level 16.

### 4. Log in to Level 16

Now, use the new password to log in to the next level:

```sh
ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

# Bandit Level 16 → Level 17 Walkthrough

## Level Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range `31000` to `32000`. First, find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then, determine which of those use SSL/TLS. Only one server will provide the next credentials; the others will echo back whatever you send to them.

## Commands You May Need

- `ssh`
- `nmap`
- `nc` (netcat)
- `openssl s_client`
- `ncat`
- `socat`
- `netstat`
- `ss`

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Log in to Level 16

Use the provided credentials to log in to the Bandit server:

```sh
ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Password for `bandit16` (from the previous level):

```
<PREVIOUS_PASSWORD>
```

### 2. Scan for Open Ports in the Range 31000-32000

Use `nmap` to scan for open ports:

```sh
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
```

This will return a list of open ports.

### 3. Identify Which Ports Use SSL/TLS

For each open port, use `openssl s_client` to check if it supports SSL/TLS:

```sh
openssl s_client -connect localhost:<PORT>
```

If it successfully connects without errors, the port is using SSL/TLS.

### 4. Submit the Password to the Correct Port

Once the correct port is identified, send the current password to it:

```sh
echo "<PREVIOUS_PASSWORD>" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:<CORRECT_PORT> -quiet
```

Alternatively, manually enter the password after connecting:

```sh
openssl s_client -connect localhost:<CORRECT_PORT>
```
Then, type the password and press **Enter**.

### 5. Retrieve the Password for Level 17

If the correct port was used, you will receive the password for `bandit17`:

```
Correct! The password for bandit17 is <NEW_PASSWORD>
```

Save this password for the next level.

### 6. Log in to Level 17

Now, use the new password to log in to the next level:

```sh
ssh bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

# Bandit Level 16 → Level 17 Walkthrough

## Level Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range `31000` to `32000`. First, find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then, determine which of those use SSL/TLS. Only one server will provide the next credentials; the others will echo back whatever you send to them.

- `openssl s_client`
- `ncat`
- `socat`
- `netstat`
- `ss`

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Log in to Level 16

Use the provided credentials to log in to the Bandit server:

```sh
ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Password for `bandit16` (from the previous level):

```
kSkvUpMQ71BYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
```

### 2. Scan for Open Ports in the Range 31000-32000

Use `nmap` to scan for open ports:

```sh
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
```

This will return a list of open ports.

### 3. Identify Which Ports Use SSL/TLS

For each open port, use `openssl s_client` to check if it supports SSL/TLS:

```sh
openssl s_client -connect localhost:<PORT> -quiet
```

If it successfully connects without errors, the port is using SSL/TLS.

### 4. Submit the Password to the Correct Port

Once the correct port is identified (31790 in this case), send the current password to it:

```sh
echo "kSkvUpMQ71BYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet
```

### 5. Retrieve the RSA Private Key for Level 17

If the correct port was used, you will receive an SSH private key. Copy the entire key, including the `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY` and `END RSA PRIVATE KEY` lines, and save it to a file:

```sh
nano /tmp/bandit17_key
```

Paste the key into the file, then save and exit (CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter).

Change the file permissions to make it readable only by you:

```sh
chmod 600 /tmp/bandit17_key
```

### 6. Log in to Level 17 Using the RSA Key

Now, use the saved key to log in as `bandit17`:

```sh
ssh -i /tmp/bandit17_key bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

# Bandit Level 17 → Level 18 Walkthrough

## Level Goal
There are two files in the home directory: `passwords.old` and `passwords.new`. The password for the next level is in `passwords.new` and is the only line that has been changed between `passwords.old` and `passwords.new`.

## Commands You May Need
- `ls` – List files in the directory
- `cat` – Display contents of a file
- `diff` – Compare two files and show differences

## Solution
1. **Connect to Bandit Level 17**
   ```sh
   ssh bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
   Password for Level 17 should be entered (retrieved from the previous level).

2. **List the files in the home directory**
   ```sh
   ls
   ```
   You should see `passwords.old` and `passwords.new`.

3. **Compare the two files using `diff`**
   ```sh
   diff passwords.old passwords.new
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   42c42
   < ktfgBvpMzWKR5ENj26IbLGSblgUG9CzB
   ---
   > x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
   ```
   The `newpasswordline` is the password for Bandit Level 18.

4. **Retrieve and store the password**
   ```sh
   diff passwords.old passwords.new | grep '>' | cut -d ' ' -f2
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
   ```
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/236c9935-2aeb-4774-aca9-9033854cf967)
  
   This extracts only the new password line.

4. **Log into Bandit Level 18**
   ```sh
   ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
   Use the retrieved password to access the next level.

## Notes
- If you see `Byebye!` when logging into Bandit 18, refer to the next level’s instructions for troubleshooting.
- The `diff` command highlights the changed lines, making it easy to find the new password.

---
**Password for Level 18:** `x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO`

# Bandit Level 18 → Level 19 Walkthrough

## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file named `readme` in the home directory. However, `.bashrc` has been modified to log you out immediately upon SSH login.

## Commands You May Need
- `ssh` – Connect to the server
- `cat` – Read file contents

## Solution
### 1. **Bypass `.bashrc` Execution**
Run the following command to read the password from `readme` without triggering the logout:
```sh
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat readme"
```
This directly retrieves the password for Bandit Level 19.

### 2. **Alternative: Start a Non-Interactive Shell**
If you want to explore the system manually, use:
```sh
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t "bash --noprofile --norc"
```
This prevents `.bashrc` from executing and allows normal command input.

## Next Steps
Once you retrieve the password, use it to log into Bandit Level 19.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67098efe-b93e-48e1-bc20-7244b8d84585)

---
**Password for Level 19:** `your_found_password_here` (replace with the actual password from `readme`)

# Bandit Level 19 → Level 20 Walkthrough

## Level Goal
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the home directory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (`/etc/bandit_pass`), after you have used the setuid binary.

## Commands You May Need
- `ls` – List files in the directory
- `./<binary_name>` – Execute the setuid binary
- `cat` – Read file contents

## Solution
1. **Connect to Bandit Level 19**
   ```sh
   ssh bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
   Enter the password retrieved from Level 18.

2. **Find the setuid binary**
   ```sh
   ls -l
   ```
   Look for a file with the setuid permission (`rwsr-xr-x`).

3. **Execute the binary**
   ```sh
   ./bandit20-do
   ```
   This should print usage instructions.

4. **Use the binary to read the password**
   ```sh
   ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
   ```
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c950f3e7-c918-4529-8c5f-67acc0340689)
   
   This command runs `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20` with elevated privileges, revealing the password for Level 20.
   

## Next Steps
Once you retrieve the password, use it to log into Bandit Level 20.

---
**Password for Level 20:** `your_found_password_here` (replace with the actual password from `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit20`)

# Bandit Level 20 → Level 21 Walkthrough

## Level Goal
There is a setuid binary in the home directory named `suconnect`. It connects to localhost on a specified port, reads a line of text from the connection, and compares it to the password from the previous level (Bandit 20). If correct, it returns the password for the next level (Bandit 21).

## Commands You May Need
- `ssh` – Connect to the server
- `nc` – Netcat for creating a listener
- `cat` – Read file contents
- `bash, screen, tmux` – Manage multiple sessions
- Unix Job Control (`bg, fg, jobs, &, CTRL-Z`)

## Solution
1. **Connect to Bandit Level 20**
   ```sh
   ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
   Enter the password retrieved from Level 19.

2. **Find the setuid binary**
   ```sh
   ls -l
   ```
   Look for a file named `suconnect` with the setuid permission (`rwsr-x---`).

3. **Start a Netcat listener in the background**
   ```sh
   nc -lvp 12345
   ```
   This opens a listening port (12345) to receive the password check request.

4. **Run `suconnect` with the same port**
   In another terminal (or using job control with `&`):
   ```sh
   ./suconnect 12345
   ```
   This will connect to the listener you started earlier.
